                    <p>I strongly believe that the path to true artificial general intelligence lies in how we handle data
                        with many modalities as well as the data where certain modes are missing. Humans are
                        incredibly flexible. Yes, we rely heavily on sight, sound, and language to understand our
                        environment, but we don’t always have the luxury of all three. Even so, we can make powerful
                        and accurate inferences with less data. Take away our vision and we can still paint a decent
                        picture of our surroundings. Given a language barrier we are still able to infer general ideas
                        based on actions and tone. This flexibility is imperative in our lives, and should be in our algorithms as well. 
                        Data isn’t always perfect; this is something that I have become intimately familiar with. Nonetheless our artificial intelligence 
                        should be able to adapt and perform strongly even in the absence of some key information.

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>I have researched alongside multiple professors at West Virginia University including Drs. Gianfranco Doretto and Xin Li. Here, I
                            massively improved my expertise in PyTorch, gained exposure to Transformer networks and multimodal learning, and worked hands-on
                            on an end-to-end project where I created a data collection tool, annotated thousands of data samples, and built a classifier 
                            on said data.

                        <h2>Educate</h2>
                        <p>Outside of AI research, I am very passionate about teaching what I know to others. From beginner AI workshops
                            to advanced topics such as Transformer encoding and decoding, I strive to 
                            make artificial intelligence accessible to anyone with the desire to learn. I have run workshops and brought in guest
                            speakers from companies such as Tesla and Noblis to speak with members of the Artificial Intelligence Club at West Virginia University.
                            I have also brought AI down to the high school level through "AI in a Day" workshops, where I taught everything from the fundamentals of
                            Python to simple neural networks for image classification.

                        <h2>Learn</h2>
                        <p>I am always eager to further my AI knowledge. I love experimenting with new models and processes to find what works best for me. 
                            The interesting thing about AI is that there is <em>always</em> something new to learn. Until recently, I was only interested in
                            computer vision, but my work with Dr. Li has opened my eyes to the importance of multimodal learning. Now, I aim to combine 
                            techniques from computer vision with natural language processing.

                            <p>Developed as part of my B.S Computer Science capstone project. This project introduces a TikTokScraper Python API that can easily search, download, 
                                and label videos from the platform. Furthermore, Vision Transformers are applied to the data in a

                                videos. It should be noted that this project acts as a stepping stone to further 
                                exploration of the data in the multimodal space by including audio and text information in future

                    <p>I am originally from Charles Town, WV, where I grew up building computers, playing lacrosse, and marching in my high school band. 
                        I completed my Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics at West Virginia University in December 2022 before moving to the greater Seattle area. 
                        In August, I will return to WVU to pursue my Ph.D in Computer Science, researching with Drs. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gMBvzGoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Xin Li</a> 
                        and <a href="http://www.pkgyawali.com/" target="_blank">Prashnna Gyawali</a>. My main research focuses will be on multimodal learning and graph neural networks.
